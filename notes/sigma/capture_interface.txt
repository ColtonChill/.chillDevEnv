## how to put already recorded stream into agent:
#########################
## Description:
This interface allows you to take the contents of a previous stream and 
restream it as if it was currently being streamed. This is useful for 
when taking new data is timely, or for unit testing.

The capture interface doesn't do much more than just listen for a data (like
UDP or TCP data stream) stream and publish it to a SIGMA stream. To use it
for testing already taken data, this comes in two parts. First, replace the 
video ifc with the capture ifc in the sigma xml configurations. This means 
you must write the appropriate configuration lines in the capture ifc cfg 
to mimic the replaced ifcs datafeed line.
And Second, a data stream from some location with data already taken to the 
destination sigma box. In the case of a recorded ts video, use ffmpeg

For example, I replaced the REALSENSE ifc with the capture ifc in the following
manner:

## This was from the REALSENSE ifc:
<datafeed feedname="Depth_Video" filename="H264" fileext="ts" datarate_KiBps="2000" logthreshold_bytes="2000" handler="VideoFeed"/>

## This is what went into the capture ifc cfg:
[Depth Stream]
feedname=Depth_Video  # The name of the feed I wanted to replace
basename=H264         # This ifc is treated just like a regular ifc so the recieved
                      # data is recorded just like any other ifc
extension=ts          # ditto ^^
ipaddr=0.0.0.0        # I imagine this is the accepting ip address, as in, from what
                      # source should I accept data 0.0.0.0 for any source
port=5601             # The port to recieve data on
mtu=1500              
sockettype=0
datarate_kbps=50000
maxreadsize_bytes=65536
threshold_bytes=2000  # Copied form the REALSENSE ifc line

## Now to stream the test video to this machine
ffmpeg does not run on every platform so you may need to run it from your
host machine. In the following example, I have copied the file I want to stream
to my machine (192.168.0.99) and am streaming to port 5601 on the sigma box (192.168.0.10).

ffmpeg -re -i ./H264_20201216_150505_478.ts -c copy -f mpegts -map 0:v -map 0:d? udp://192.168.0.10:5601

or you can use netcat:

cat ./H264_20201216_150505_478.ts | pv -L 516k | nc -u 192.168.0.10 5601

                                      Sigma Machine
