  make new engine (engines/detectionEngins/segmentationEngine)
    * make as library
    * only my link engine to my detector
    * Does the AI processing
  make new detector (detector/segmentationDetector)
    * Does the output


Note: Make sure to create DetectorEnginBass::getEngine link it is in TenssorrtDetector.cpp

submit mesurments gets called once per frame, and might be where we need to save off points per frame. (Currently in newer branch).

Definitions:
- Engins works with the lowerlevel utils to make detections
- Detector sucks up detection and calls make mesurements.

Submit messure might need to be handeled for empty

At makeMessure, write out vector.
